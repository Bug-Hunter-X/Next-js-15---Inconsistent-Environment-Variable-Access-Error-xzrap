# Next.js 15 Environment Variable Access Issue

This repository demonstrates a seemingly inconsistent error when trying to access environment variables within a Next.js 15 application. The error manifests primarily in production builds or under specific conditions and is related to how environment variables are handled within Next.js's serverless function model.

## Problem Description

The `about.js` component attempts to log an environment variable (`process.env.MY_VARIABLE`).  This works fine during development, but occasionally fails in production,  returning `undefined` or throwing an error.  The inconsistency makes debugging difficult.

## Proposed Solution

The provided solution utilizes `next/config` to ensure the environment variables are correctly injected and accessible across pages.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add a `.env.local` file (or equivalent for your preferred environment variable loading mechanism) with  `MY_VARIABLE=myValue`. 
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` (this should work).
5. Build and deploy the application to observe the intermittent error in production (this may require some setup).

## Solution

The updated `about.js` uses the `next/config` module to reliably access environment variables.  This is a more robust approach than direct access via `process.env`.
